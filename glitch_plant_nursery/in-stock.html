              This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. The bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus. It will grow in lightly                     shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows or prairies. Additionally it is found growing alongside                     streams and rivers. The plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves have withered. Bulbs should be planted in the autumn.                   Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.

              With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge bells that dangle above bright emerald-green leaves -- this nearly deer-proof                  shade lover appears to be delicate in an old-fashioned way. But the pretty plant is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily                 and rapidly, and anyone who gardens in a small space will want to watch this perennial to make sure it stays in bounds. Tolerates               shade well. <strong>WARNING: This plant is poisonous!</strong>

        These charming little blooming plants hail from Argentina and Uruguay and form dense clumps of perennial flowers to chase the winter             doldrums away. These flowers spring from fall planted bulbs. They can get up to half a foot tall with a similar spread. Each bulb will           produce numerous flowering stems with slender, deeply green foliage. Blooms are fragrant and star shaped with six blue or white petals.

        We have a wide variety of tulips in many colors. Plant tulip bulbs in the fall, 6 to 8 weeks before a hard frost is expected and when           soils are below 60 degrees Fahrenheit (F).
